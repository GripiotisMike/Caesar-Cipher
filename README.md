# Caesar Cipher üõ°Ô∏è

- In this Project I learned how to use Functions with inputs!

- Also I learnded how simple Encryption/Decryption works!

- A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. Encode or decode your messages by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts or decrypts any text using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Automatically handles shifts greater than 26 by wrapping them within the alphabet range.
- Retains non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, numbers, or punctuation) as-is.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a terminal:
   ```bash
   main.py
